## The architecture of the application is MVVM

## When the app is up

- I load the data from the server and store in a view model,
- and deletes objects that have been stored in the database for more than a day.

## Main screen 
- I show the popular movies and the top rated movies by listening to the Live Data

## Search screen 
- With each click I call a server to display movies by name,

## favorites
- Each time you click on a movie, the movie's screen opens and you can add it to your favorites
- I save my favorite movies in Room database
- In the favorites screen, I pull the movies from the data base and display them
